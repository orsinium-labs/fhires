// A Map of relationships between 2 structures that can be used to transform data.
//
// Status: draft
//
// http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/StructureMap
type StructureMap struct {
	// The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource.
	//
	// Once assigned, this value never changes.
	//
	// Comment: Within the context of the FHIR RESTful interactions, the resource has an id except for cases like the create and conditional update. Otherwise, the use of the resouce id depends on the given use case.
	ID *string `bson:"id,omitempty" json:"id,omitempty" xml:"id,omitempty"`
	// The metadata about the resource.
	//
	// This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
	Meta *Meta `bson:"meta,omitempty" json:"meta,omitempty" xml:"meta,omitempty"`
	// A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
	//
	// Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
	//
	// Comment: Asserting this rule set restricts the content to be only understood by a limited set of trading partners. This inherently limits the usefulness of the data in the long term. However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally computable sense. Wherever possible, implementers and/or specification writers should avoid using this element. Often, when used, the URL is a reference to an implementation guide that defines these special rules as part of its narrative along with other profiles, value sets, etc.
	ImplicitRules *string `bson:"implicitRules,omitempty" json:"implicitRules,omitempty" xml:"implicitRules,omitempty"`
	// The base language in which the resource is written.
	//
	// Comment: Language is provided to support indexing and accessibility (typically, services such as text to speech use the language tag). The html language tag in the narrative applies  to the narrative. The language tag on the resource may be used to specify the language of other presentations generated from the data in the resource. Not all the content has to be in the base language. The Resource.language should not be assumed to apply to the narrative automatically. If a language is specified, it should it also be specified on the div element in the html (see rules in HTML5 for information about the relationship between xml:lang and the html lang attribute).
	Language *string `bson:"language,omitempty" json:"language,omitempty" xml:"language,omitempty"`
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human.
	//
	// The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
	//
	// Comment: Contained resources do not have a narrative. Resources that are not contained SHOULD have a narrative. In some cases, a resource may only have text with little or no additional discrete data (as long as all minOccurs=1 elements are satisfied).  This may be necessary for data from legacy systems where information is captured as a "text blob" or where text is additionally entered raw or narrated and encoded information is added later.
	Text *Narrative `bson:"text,omitempty" json:"text,omitempty" xml:"text,omitempty"`
	// These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
	//
	// This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
	//
	// Comment: This should never be done when the content can be identified properly, as once identification is lost, it is extremely difficult (and context dependent) to restore it again. Contained resources may have profiles and tags in their meta elements, but SHALL NOT have security labels.
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource.
	//
	// To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
	//
	// Comment: There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.
	Extension []Extension `bson:"extension,omitempty" json:"extension,omitempty" xml:"extension,omitempty"`
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants.

Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

	// An absolute URI that is used to identify this structure map when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier.
	//
	// This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which an authoritative instance of this structure map is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the structure map is stored on different servers.
	//
	// Comment: Can be a urn:uuid: or a urn:oid: but real http: addresses are preferred.  Multiple instances may share the same URL if they have a distinct version.
	//
	// The determination of when to create a new version of a resource (same url, new version) vs. defining a new artifact is up to the author.  Considerations for making this decision are found in [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions).
	//
	// In some cases, the resource can no longer be found at the stated url, but the url itself cannot change. Implementations can use the [meta.source](resource.html#meta) element to indicate where the current master source of the resource can be found.
	URL string `bson:"url" json:"url" xml:"url"`
	// A formal identifier that is used to identify this structure map when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
	//
	// Comment: Typically, this is used for identifiers that can go in an HL7 V3 II (instance identifier) data type, and can then identify this structure map outside of FHIR, where it is not possible to use the logical URI.
	Identifier []Identifier `bson:"identifier,omitempty" json:"identifier,omitempty" xml:"identifier,omitempty"`
	// The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure map when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
	//
	// This is an arbitrary value managed by the structure map author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
	//
	// Comment: There may be different structure map instances that have the same identifier but different versions.  The version can be appended to the url in a reference to allow a reference to a particular business version of the structure map with the format [url]|[version]. The version SHOULD NOT contain a '#' - see [Business Version](resource.html#bv-format).
	Version *string `bson:"version,omitempty" json:"version,omitempty" xml:"version,omitempty"`
	// Indicates the mechanism used to compare versions to determine which is more current.
	//
	// Comment: If set as a string, this is a FHIRPath expression that has two additional context variables passed in - %version1 and %version2 and will return a negative number if version1 is newer, a positive number if version2 and a 0 if the version ordering can't be successfully be determined.

	//
	// The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the structure map changes.
	//
	// Comment: The date is often not tracked until the resource is published, but may be present on draft content. Note that this is not the same as the resource last-modified-date, since the resource may be a secondary representation of the structure map. Additional specific dates may be added as extensions or be found by consulting Provenances associated with past versions of the resource.
